# Tesla-eSite

## Getting Started

Tesla-eSite is a Next.js application designed to help configure industrial energy battery sites using Tesla's Megapack and Powerpack products. Follow the steps below to get the project running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrjasan/tesla-esite.git
cd tesla-esite
```

### Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies by running the following command at the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The app is also deployed live here: [https://tesla-esite.fly.dev/](https://tesla-esite.fly.dev/)

## Development History

This project was developed in several stages. The commit history provides a detailed record of the actions taken. Below is a summary of the key steps:

1. Created a Next.js app with Tailwind CSS - [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app)
2. Added Jest for unit testing - [Next.js Testing with Jest](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing/jest)
3. Integrated Redux and React-Redux for state management
4. Implemented Redux-Persist for state persistence
5. Set Universal-Sans font to align with Tesla's brand
6. Added the Tesla logo
7. Set up the layout, header, and footer components
8. Created sample device data
9. Integrated ShadCN components - [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
10. Updated the sidebar layout and components
11. Set up Redux slice for managing the state of the site configuration
12. Created EnergySite class for calculating energy site metrics and layout
13. Implemented energy site layout preview
14. Implemented submit order functionality
15. Set up Redux slice to manage and persist a list of configurations
16. Removed redundant slice to manage individual sites and consolidated on the site collection slice
17. Added landing page
18. Set up navigation between landing page, site manager, and editor
19. Implemented site manager UI
20. Setup tests with Jest
21. Setup [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) deployment using Github actions

## Project Discussion

### Functional Requirements

The functional requirements outlined in the challenge document are addressed in the following way:

- **User Input for Devices**: The UI allows users to enter the number of each device they want. The application shows the price, land dimension required, and the site's energy density (assuming total energy on the site, there's another interpretation which is the amount of energy by unit of area that was not used). The UI also shows pictures and detailed descriptions of each device.
- **Transformer Requirement**: For every four industrial batteries bought, one transformer is automatically added. Important to consider that in mthis implementation the user can not directly manage the amount of transformers.
- **Autogenerated Site Layout**: The UI generates a layout showing the arrangement of batteries based on the user's configuration.
- **Site Layout Constraints**: The site layout does not exceed 100ft in width.
- **Single Command to Run**: The entire application is runnable with one command (`npm run dev`).
- **Local Hosting**: The front-end service runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) when hosted locally.

### Additional Features

- **Energy Site Layout Manager**: Developed a layout manager to visually represent the arrangement of devices within the site. Users can rearrange the layout of their devices and see additional details.
- **Persistence of Site Configuration**: Ensured site configurations are stored and retrievable for future.
- **Collection Management**: Added functionality to manage a collection of site configurations, allowing users to create, update, and delete configurations.
- **Deployment and Hosting**: The app is also hosted at [https://tesla-esite.fly.dev/](https://tesla-esite.fly.dev/)

## Future Improvements
- **Aditional Site Context**: Implement functionality to collect the site geo location, and overlay the site layout on the map.
- **Persisting Selected Layouts**: Implement functionality to also persist the custom layout generated by the user.
- **Exporting and Emailing Configurations**: Allow users to export site configurations to a file format (e.g., PDF) and email them.
- **Additional Testing**: Increase test coverage to include rendering of elements and components, ensuring the UI works as expected.
- **Responsive Design**: Make the application responsive to provide a functional and pleasant experience in any form factor, both for mobile devices and desktop environments.
